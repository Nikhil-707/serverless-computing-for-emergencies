# üåê Serverless Computing for Cloud Backup Power: Challenges and Solutions ‚ö°

This repository contains the research, analysis, and findings on the use of serverless computing for cloud backup power, focusing on the challenges and proposing solutions to enhance reliability, security, and scalability. We employ various machine learning techniques to predict and analyze output parameters of serverless computing using Power Measurement Units (PMUs).

## üìÑ Abstract

The present study explores the challenges and limitations of using serverless computing for cloud backup power and proposes solutions to improve its reliability, security, and scalability. Serverless computing offers several advantages for emergencies, including scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. However, challenges such as cold boot delays, resource limitations, lack of infrastructure control, security concerns, monitoring, debugging issues, and vendor lock-in need to be addressed. This research examines techniques to reduce cold boot delays, optimize resource allocation, implement effective security measures, ensure vendor independence, and improve monitoring and debugging capabilities. The findings guide emergency response organizations, cloud service providers, and other stakeholders to effectively use serverless computing as a backup power source for cloud-based power grids.

## üìä Results and Analysis

### üå≥ Decision Tree Regression Model

To forecast the output parameters of serverless computing, we employ a decision tree regression model. This model captures non-linear relationships and handles both numerical and categorical features.

**Dataset:**

| üßÆ Function Invocation # | üíæ Memory Used (MB) | ‚è± Duration (ms) | üîã CPU Utilization (%) | üåê Network Latency (ms) |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Func 1                | 256              | 250           | 50                  | 5                    |
| Func 2                | 128              | 150           | 75                  | 8                    |
| Func 3                | 512              | 300           | 60                  | 10                   |
| Func 4                | 256              | 200           | 45                  | 7                    |
| Func 5                | 128              | 175           | 70                  | 9                    |

**Performance Metrics:**

- **Memory Used**: MSE - 7692.59 MB
- **Duration**: MSE - 12754.17 ms
- **CPU Utilization**: MSE - 512.50%
- **Network Latency**: MSE - 1.44 ms

The decision tree regression model provides insights into the significance of each input parameter in determining the output parameters. The model performs best on predicting Network Latency with the lowest MSE of 1.44 ms, and worst on predicting CPU Utilization with an MSE of 512.50%.

### üìà Linear Regression Model

Using multiple linear regression, we predict CPU utilization based on memory usage, duration, and network latency.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

| Metric           | Value                  |
|------------------|------------------------|
| MSE              | 7353.46                |
| RMSE             | 85.75                  |
| R-squared        | -10.77                 |

The linear regression model is not a suitable choice for our dataset, as indicated by the R-squared value.

### üå≤ Random Forest Model

We use a random forest model to analyze the importance of each input parameter in determining the output parameters. This approach helps identify the factors that significantly impact serverless computing performance.

## üÜö Comparison between Serverless and Traditional Computing

We conduct a comparative analysis between serverless computing and traditional computing models based on performance metrics like memory usage, network latency, duration, and CPU utilization.

**Box Plot Comparison:**

**T-test p-values for Performance Metrics:**

| Performance Metric | t-test p-value |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Memory Usage       | 0.5367         |
| Duration           | 0.9517         |
| CPU Utilization    | 1.0            |
| Network Latency    | 0.5285         |

Serverless computing has a significant advantage over traditional computing in terms of Duration and CPU Utilization but not in terms of Memory Usage and Network Latency.
